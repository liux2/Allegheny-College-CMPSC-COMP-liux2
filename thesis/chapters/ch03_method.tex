\chapter{Method of Approach}
\label{ch:method}

This chapter should answer the ``how'' question - how did you complete your project, including the overall design of your study, details of the algorithms and tools you have used, etc.
 Use technical diagrams, equations, algorithms, and paragraphs of text to
describe the research that you have completed. Be sure to number all figures and tables and to explicitly refer to them in your text.
