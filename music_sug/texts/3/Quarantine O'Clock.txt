I feel very out of energy. I feel like I am dazed, tired, and mentally exhausted. I have no motivation to be productive. I want to eat a variety of foods but I am stuck with the same foods and snacks at home. I want to hang out with my friends, but my parents are restricting me. I want to go eat out at restaurants, but I can't. Everyday is so repetitive. I want the quarantine to end because it is making me miserable. At the same time, I am at the comfort of my own home. I am not at school right now. 

I want to rank up in an online competitive video game. It is a goal for me to reach to the top of the ladder. I like to think that I am really skilled, but I have to prove myself for that. I want to show that I am worthy of being a great player. Most people determine superiority in skill if they see your rank because it is a qualification. I must push myself to my maximum capacity.

Today is a cold day. It is raining outside. I want to watch a movie and eat popcorn. I'd rather be next to a fireplace. The house is cozy. I want to play with my cat. I also want to sleep for a long time after the day is over. The bed is so relaxing when I am tired. I can't wait for the day to end. Where is the night time?
